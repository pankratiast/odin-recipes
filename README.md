This is a quick project I'm making as part of The Odin Project more broadly.

I'm hoping to include a basic list of recipes I quite like and use frequently as home. I'm not a gourmet chef, but I do enjoy making dishes for myself, friends, and family. Hence I typically have a lot of mouths to feed.

As such, I have crafted a number of dishes that are... 
1. High protein
2. Easy to cook en masse
3. Cheap

Hope you enjoy.

Bon apettit!

Skills I'll sharpen with this project are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Pushing to GitHub from the CLI

As for JavaScript, I'm not sure this is going to get complex enough to warrant such a thing.
