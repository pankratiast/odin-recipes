    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple and delicious shakshuka featuring eggs cooked over easy/medium in a skillet with sweet cherry tomatoes and a dollop of low-fat cottage cheese. Enhanced with optional pepper and red pepper flakes, this dish is perfect for dipping bread to scoop up the flavorful egg, cheese, and tomato mixture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Sweet cherry tomatoes (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>Low-fat cottage cheese (to taste)</li>
        <li>Pepper (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Bread (for dipping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over low heat. Add the sweet cherry tomatoes and mash them gently with a spoon or spatula until they release their juices and form a saucy base, cooking for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Create small wells in the tomato mixture and crack the 3 eggs into the wells. Cook the eggs over medium heat until they reach an over easy/medium consistency (about 3-5 minutes), covering the skillet to help the eggs set.</li>
        <li>Dollop low-fat cottage cheese into the skillet, distributing it around the eggs.</li>
        <li>Season with pepper and red pepper flakes to taste, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, dipping bread into the skillet to scoop up the egg, cheese, and tomato mixture.</li>
    </ol>
